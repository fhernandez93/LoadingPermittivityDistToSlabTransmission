20250417_transmission_quasiicosahedral10subdivided3d_K50_1.h5 contains three keys: 

transmission: which is an array of shape (400,) containing the transmission spectra for 400 frequencies of the sample 
nu: the reduced frequencies a/lambda 
frequencies: frequencies in Hz from the FDTD solver 

The characteristic length of the system was calculated as L/N_total_points^1/3 = 2.28633544894176e-2

I took the original sample of points uasiicosahedral10subdivided3d_K50 and took a chunk of size 0.143 (considering 1 unit the total size of the square containing all the points)

We performed the tessellation process described in Nature Communications volume 11, Article number: 4867 (2020)

The final slab consist of a cube of size 14.3um with a\approx.2.29um 

ff=0.30 

n_rod=3.4
