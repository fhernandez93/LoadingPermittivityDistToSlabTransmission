quasiicosahedral2subdivided3d_K15_92Peaks_rad_0.01_eps.h5 contains three keys: 

transmission: which is an array of shape (400,) containing the transmission spectra for 400 frequencies of the sample 
nu: the reduced frequencies a/lambda 
frequencies: frequencies in Hz from the FDTD solver 

The characteristic length of the system was calculated as L/N_total_points^1/3 = 0.07292048568852678

I took the original sample of points quasiicosahedral2subdivided3d_K15 and scale it up to be a 20x20x20mu slab (assuming the original as 1x1x1um the total size of the square containing all the points)

We performed the tessellation process described in Nature Communications volume 11, Article number: 4867 (2020)

The final slab consist of a cube of size 20um with a=1.4584097137705356um
